*c_CTRL-O.txt*	One-shot normal mode for command-line mode

OVERVIEW					*c_CTRL-O-overview*

This plugin introduces a natural analogue to |i_CTRL-O| for command-line mode.
When partway through writing a command-line or performing an incremental
search with |c_CTRL-G| and |c_CTRL-T|, you might:

	- Redraw the screen with CTRL-O CTRL-L.
	- Peek at what function or section you're in with CTRL-O [[.
	- Peek at the definition for the current match with CTRL-O gd,
	  CTRL-O gD, CTRL-O [ CTRL-I, etc.
	- Scroll around with CTRL-O zt, CTRL-O CTRL-D, CTRL-O zL, etc.
	- Perform a nested search with CTRL-O /{pattern}<CR>, then peek at
	  subsequent matches with CTRL-O n.
	- Execute nested command-lines like CTRL-O :se {option}<CR>,
	  CTRL-O :w<CR>, etc.

MAPPINGS					*c_CTRL-O-mappings*

						*c_CTRL-O*
CTRL-O		Execute one normal-mode command then return to command-line
		mode. The command is performed under |textlock|. Works like
		|i_CTRL-O|.

						*c_CTRL-\_CTRL-O*
CTRL-\ CTRL-O	Abandon the command-line, go to normal mode without moving
		the cursor. This differs from |c_CTRL-C| and |c_<CR>| during
		an incremental search |'incsearch'|, after using |c_CTRL-O|
		to move the cursor off of the latest match. Specifically,
			CTRL-C		Jumps to the original cursor position.
			<CR>		Jumps to the latest match.
			CTRL-\ CTRL-O	Does not move the cursor.
		The |jumplist| is updated with the original cursor position.

CTRL-R CTRL-O {motion}				*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-O*
		Insert {motion} text into the command-line as if typed. The
		text is also put into the unnamed register.

CTRL-R CTRL-R CTRL-O {motion}			*c_CTRL-R_CTRL-R_CTRL-O*
		Insert {motion} text into the command-line literally. The
		text is also put into the unnamed register. Works like
		|c_CTRL-R_CTRL-O| but inserts the text literally.
